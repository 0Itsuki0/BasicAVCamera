#  Camera App

A Camera App implemented in swiftUI using AVFoundation Framework \ 
Specifically, this app will allows you to 
- Take the photo and record the video! (Too obvious!)
- Preview our capture device (that is the camera) output
- Switch between the front and back camera
- Switch between photo and video
- Review what we have taken or recorded
- And, save the photo or the video to Photo Library (or not)Â !
